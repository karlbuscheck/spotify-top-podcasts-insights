# Spotify Podcast Performance Analysis

This project explores key questions about podcast rankings on Spotify using Python-based data analysis and machine learning.

## Questions Explored
1. **Do podcasts need video content to reach the Top 10?**
   - Analyzed chart data across 22 geographical regions to compare performance of video vs. audio-only podcasts.

2. **Can we predict which episodes will stay in the Top 50?**
   - Built a Random Forest Classifer model using chart history and episode features.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Spotify Top 200 Episodes Chart Data

## Next Steps
- Refine visualizations for clearer storytelling
- Explore additional modeling techniques like logistic regression and XGBoost
